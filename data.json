And it works just fine. What's the detection rate for mod menus? Really high. And it seems that it doesn't matter what you do too.\n  \n    When I permanently banned I was making the kuruma go like 10% faster and then within the same hour, banned. And that was with stand ultimate.\n  \n    So yeah. Don't use stand. Get lexis.",
